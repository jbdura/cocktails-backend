# Phase 3 Project Build Backend
Cocktail project.

### Requirements
* Ruby 2.7.2
* sqlite3 3.32.3

### How to use
First, please fork and clone the github repository to your local machine. Then in your terminal cd into the project directory and type "bundle install". Look for the main branch-this is the one that holds the most up to date information. If need be, type "rake db:migrate" in order to run the migrations and then "rake db:seed" to seed the data.

After that, run "rake server", and the backend is set up at this point. Navigate to "http://localhost:3000/" for the front end.
